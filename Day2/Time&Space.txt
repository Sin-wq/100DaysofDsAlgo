Time Complexity:
    It is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run.
    As a function of length of the input.

Why?
    For making better programs.
    Comparison of algorithm.

Big O -> Upper Bound
Theta -> For Avg-Case Complexity
Omega -> Lower Bound

->Constant Time -> O(1) 
->Linear Time -> O(n)
->Logarthmic Time -> O(logn)
->Quadratic Time -> O(n^2)
->Cubic Time -> (n^3)

10^8 operation rule:
    Most of the modern machine can perform 10^8 operation per second.


Space Complexity:
    Total amount of memory space used by an algorithm or program.
